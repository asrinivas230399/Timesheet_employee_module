# Role-Based Access Control Policies

## Overview
The `role_based_access.py` module is responsible for managing role-based access control (RBAC) within the Budget Allocation System. It ensures that only authorized users can access specific functionalities based on their roles.

## Functions

### `is_authorized(role)`
- **Description**: Checks if a user is authorized based on their role.
- **Parameters**:
  - `role` (str): The role of the user.
- **Returns**: `True` if the role is authorized, `False` otherwise.

### `define_roles()`
- **Description**: Defines roles and their associated permissions.
- **Returns**: A dictionary mapping roles to their permissions.

### `check_access(role, permission)`
- **Description**: Checks if a role has the specified permission.
- **Parameters**:
  - `role` (str): The role of the user.
  - `permission` (str): The permission to check.
- **Returns**: `True` if the role has the permission, `False` otherwise.

### `audit_access_log()`
- **Description**: Audits the access logs to review access attempts.

## Usage
1. **Authorization Check**: Use `is_authorized()` to verify if a user has the necessary role.
2. **Permission Check**: Use `check_access()` to verify if a role has a specific permission.
3. **Audit Logs**: Use `audit_access_log()` to review access attempts and ensure compliance.
